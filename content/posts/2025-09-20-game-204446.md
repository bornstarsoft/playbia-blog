Microsoft has once again raised the prices of its Xbox consoles in the United States, just five months after the last hike. This latest increase, effective from October 3, reflects the company's response to the changing macroeconomic environment. The Xbox Series X and S models will see price increases ranging from $20 to $70, making them more expensive than ever before.

The new prices for the consoles are significant, with the Xbox Series X now retailing at $649.99 and the Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Edition reaching a staggering $799.99. This puts the Xbox Series X at a higher price point than the PS5 Pro, which also offers 2TB of storage. Interestingly, Microsoft has stated that prices for controllers and headsets will remain unchanged, leaving gamers to ponder the value of their console investment.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these price adjustments affect consumer behavior and competition in the market. Will gamers continue to invest in Xbox consoles despite the rising costs?
