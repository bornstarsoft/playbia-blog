Team Afternoon is set to release their innovative game "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026, and it promises to bring a refreshing twist to the indie gaming scene. This free-to-play title on Steam invites players to step into the shoes of a video editor tasked with crafting a perfect "fake clear video" from a series of failed dungeon raids, all set against a nostalgic Windows 98 backdrop.

The challenge lies in the precision required; as the developers put it, "Not a single frame of compromise is acceptable when it comes to creating miracles." This unique blend of turn-based strategy, puzzle-solving, and simulation is sure to captivate gamers looking for something different.

As we approach the release date, the satirical narrative woven into the gameplayhighlighting the contrast between the perceived heroism and the chaotic realityinvites players to reflect on the nature of success and failure in gaming. Will you be ready to create your own perfect victory?
