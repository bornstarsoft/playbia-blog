After over two decades of writing about games, I am thrilled to announce that I have finally achieved a long-held dream: being credited in a video game! My contributions to AHRO, an innovative indie title by OEH Interactive, have been recognized, and I couldnt be more excited. This unique game, which features deep lore and no combat, has just launched its free v2.0 version on platforms like Steam, Switch, Linux, and Atari VCS.

Having my name listed in the credits not once, but twice, is a significant milestone for me. Its a testament to the hard work and passion Ive poured into the gaming industry over the years. Being part of the QA and promotion for this title has been an incredible experience, and I am honored to contribute to such a distinctive project.

As I reflect on this achievement, I can't help but wonder what the future holds for indie games and the role of passionate writers and influencers in shaping their success. What milestones are you aiming for in your own journey?
