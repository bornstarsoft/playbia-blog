Recently, an intriguing advertisement for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was spotted at the Oxford Circus tube station in London, boldly declaring that the game is "out now." This eye-catching claim has sparked excitement among fans, but the reality is a bit more complicated. According to a Nintendo spokesperson, the ad's message is incorrect, and the game isn't actually available yet. Instead, it's slated for a 2025 release, leaving many to wonder about the implications of such a misleading advertisement.

The presence of the "Out Now" message raises questions about the marketing strategies employed by game developers. It seems that there may have been a mix-up in the ad creation process, possibly copying a template from another campaign. This incident not only highlights the importance of accuracy in advertising but also suggests that Metroid Prime 4 is receiving significant promotional attention alongside other upcoming titles for the Nintendo Switch 2, like Donkey Kong Bananza and Super Mario Party Jamboree TV.

As we await further announcements regarding Metroid Prime 4, this incident serves as a reminder of the anticipation surrounding new game releases. With the gaming community buzzing, one can't help but wonder: will we see a formal release date announcement soon, or will this mystery continue to unfold?
