Steam has just added five exciting new free games that you can download and keep forever, making it a perfect time for gamers to expand their libraries without spending a dime. While the quality of these titles varies, they each offer unique gameplay experiences that could pique your interest. Thanks to the Twitter account Free Steam Games for compiling this list, we can dive into what each game has to offer.

First up is **GeTrix**, a Tetris-like puzzle game that introduces intuitive hand-tracking controls, allowing players to engage in a fresh way. Then there's **CrimeBloc**, a gritty text-based MMO that has polarized opinions among playersâ€”some find it confusing while others hail it as a masterpiece. If racing is more your style, **Drift Legends 2** offers a mixed reception, with some players feeling that it's nearly impossible to progress without purchasing DLC. The visual novel **Future Cowboy** lets you step into the shoes of a futuristic cowboy detective, although it has only a few reviews to gauge its quality. Finally, **Ventomori** stands out as a first-person exploration puzzle game, reminiscent of Portal 2, with generally positive feedback despite some minor bugs.

With these five new additions, there's something for everyone on Steam. Which game are you most excited to try? Let us know in the comments!
