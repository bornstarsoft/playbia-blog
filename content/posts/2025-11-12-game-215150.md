Sony's recent State of Play presentation focused exclusively on games from Japan and Asia, showcasing a whopping 28 announcements over a 40-minute runtime. Among the highlights was the reveal of the highly anticipated **Dragon Quest VII Reimagined**, set to launch on February 5, 2026, along with a slew of other exciting titles that cater to a diverse range of gaming preferences.

From indie gems like **InKONBINI: One Store, Many Stories** to major franchises like **Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake**, the presentation offered something for everyone. Notably, the new **PS5 Digital Japanese Edition** was announced at a reduced price, making it more accessible for fans in Japan.
