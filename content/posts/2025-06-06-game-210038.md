This fall, gamers are in for a treat with the arrival of **UnLoop**, a unique puzzle game that promises to twist your perception of time and challenge your problem-solving skills. Developed by CM Games, known for their work on *Into the Radius 2*, UnLoop invites players to engage in a captivating experience where you must literally help yourself by recording and stacking your actions to navigate through a vibrant yet perilous space station.

Set in the Temporal Research Hub, players will face a series of immersive puzzles that require not just quick thinking but also strategic planning. With obstacles like turrets and laser walls, the gameplay mechanics encourage players to sacrifice their avatars to progress, adding a layer of complexity and excitement. Each sector of the Atompunk-inspired map, such as the Nexus Frame and Asset Assembly Factory, introduces new chaos-inducing mechanics, ensuring that no two challenges are the same.

As we anticipate the release of UnLoop on Quest and Pico, with a PC VR port on the horizon, itâ€™s clear that this game is set to push the boundaries of what we expect from virtual reality experiences. Will you be ready to dive into the time-looping chaos and solve the mysteries of the Temporal Research Hub?
