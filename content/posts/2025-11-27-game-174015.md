At the Golden Joystick Awards 2025, Ghost of Yotei emerged victorious, clinching the prestigious title of Console Game of the Year. This accolade is a testament to the game's captivating narrative and stunning visuals, which have resonated with players worldwide. Developed by Sucker Punch Productions, Ghost of Yotei serves as a standalone sequel to the critically acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima, introducing players to a new protagonist, Atsu, who embarks on a gripping quest for vengeance in the breathtaking landscapes of Mount Yotei.

The game not only captivates with its story set in 1603 Japan but also impresses with its dynamic weather effects, enhancing the immersive experience. The shift from the original game's stance system to a weapon counter system further distinguishes Atsu's gameplay from that of Jin Sakai, offering fresh mechanics that keep players engaged. As the gaming community celebrates this win, it raises the question: what innovations can we expect from Sucker Punch Productions in future titles?
