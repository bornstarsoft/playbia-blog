Highguard, the latest free-to-play shooter from Wildlight Entertainment, has made a significant splash on its launch day, attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam. However, this impressive player count is overshadowed by a staggering 13,000 negative reviews, revealing a divided reception among gamers. The game's expansive map size has been a particular point of contention, with many players feeling it doesn't suit the 3vs3 matchups.

Despite the mixed reviews, the game's debut at The Game Awards generated substantial buzz, especially as it was the final announcement of the event. This slot is typically reserved for major franchises, making Highguard's placement noteworthy. Developed by a team of industry veterans, including former Respawn and Call of Duty developers, the game promises a commitment to quality and innovation.

As Highguard navigates its early days, it will be interesting to see how the developers respond to player feedback and whether they can turn the tide of public opinion. Will they address the concerns raised by the community, or will the negative reviews continue to haunt this promising title?
