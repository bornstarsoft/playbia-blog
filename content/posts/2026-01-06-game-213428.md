But thats not allSega is also hosting a free in-game Pac-Man Festival from January 7 to January 11, allowing all players to join in on the fun, regardless of their purchase status.

The Pac-Man content follows a series of successful collaborations, including characters from SpongeBob SquarePants and Minecraft, and hints at an exciting year ahead with more paid content featuring beloved franchises like Mega Man and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
