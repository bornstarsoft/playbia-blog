Nintendo has officially launched its Virtual Boy app on Switch Online, bringing back a selection of games from one of its most infamous consoles. Players can now dive into nostalgia with seven titles available at launch, including classics like 3D Tetris and Virtual Boy Wario Land. However, to access these games, users will need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership and a physical Virtual Boy accessory, which can be purchased separately.

The app not only revives the spirit of the Virtual Boy but also promises to expand its library with nine additional games in the future. This means that fans will soon have access to nearly the entire catalog of the Virtual Boy, which had a total of only 22 games during its original run. While some titles may never make it to the service due to licensing issues, the current lineup is a great way for both new players and nostalgic fans to experience this unique piece of gaming history. Will you be picking up the Virtual Boy accessory to relive these classic games?
