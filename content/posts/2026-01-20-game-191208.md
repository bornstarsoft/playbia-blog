Japan's console game market has experienced a remarkable surge, growing by 138.8% in 2025, largely fueled by the highly anticipated launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. According to data from Kadokawa Game Linkage and Famitsu, the market reached an impressive 418.13 billion yen (approximately $2.64 billion USD) by the end of the year, marking a significant milestone for the gaming industry in Japan.

The growth can be attributed to a staggering 149.3% increase in hardware sales and a 121.0% rise in physical software sales compared to the previous year. The Nintendo Switch 2 alone sold nearly 3.8 million units, contributing significantly to this boom. With blockbuster titles like Mario Kart World and Pokmon Legends: Z-A leading the sales charts, the future of gaming in Japan looks incredibly promising.

As we look ahead to 2026, the excitement continues with upcoming titles such as Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Resident Evil Requiem set to launch on the Switch 2. Will this momentum sustain, and how will it shape the global gaming landscape? Only time will tell.
