In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers everywhere, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only highlights the long-standing anticipation for a Portal 3 but also positions ChromaGun 2 as a potential successor to one of the most beloved puzzle games in history. With its unique gameplay mechanics and vibrant aesthetics, this sequel aims to carve its own niche in the puzzle genre.

While the game draws comparisons to Portal, particularly in its setting where players assist a company in testing new technology, the gameplay mechanics seem to lean more towards titles like Qube and Qube 2. Players will utilize a colorful gun to manipulate objects and solve puzzles, which may lack the iconic portals but promises to deliver engaging challenges nonetheless. A free demo is available on Steam, allowing players to experience the vibrant world of ChromaGun 2 firsthand.

The original ChromaGun, released in 2016, received 'Mostly Positive' reviews, setting the stage for high expectations for its sequel. As Pixel Maniacs continues to innovate within the puzzle genre, fans are left wondering: can ChromaGun 2 truly capture the magic of its predecessors while forging its own identity? Only time will tell.
