In a bold move that has sent shockwaves through the gaming community, Microsoft has confirmed that Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming title, The Outer Worlds 2, will be the first Xbox game to launch at a staggering price of $80. This decision follows Nintendo's controversial pricing strategy with Mario Kart World, setting a new industry standard that many gamers are questioning. The irony is palpable, as the game itself satirizes corporate greed, yet it enters the market with a price tag that has sparked outrage among fans.

The announcement was made during the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, where Obsidian unveiled a new trailer and a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development. While the gameplay promises to deliver the same engaging FPS/RPG experience as its predecessor, the hefty price point has led to a wave of backlash on platforms like Steam and X. Players have expressed disbelief and frustration, with many labeling the price as "insane" and "tone deaf." The Premium Edition, priced at $100, adds fuel to the fire with its array of extras, including early access and exclusive in-game items.

As the gaming industry grapples with rising costs, The Outer Worlds 2's pricing strategy raises important questions about the future of AAA games. Will this trend continue, and how will it affect consumer trust and engagement? As we await the game's release, one can't help but wonder if this bold pricing move will pay off or lead to a reckoning in the gaming world.
