Square Enix's recent comparison video of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade across the Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC platforms reveals an intriguing insight: the new Switch 2 can deliver impressive visual quality despite its lesser power compared to the other consoles. The video showcases the opening sequence of the game, and while there are subtle differences in texture quality, the overall visual fidelity remains surprisingly consistent across all platforms.

One of the standout points from the video is the frame rate limitation; running at a stable 30 frames per second makes it challenging to evaluate performance differences fully. The PS5 and PC versions boast a performance mode that allows for 60fps gameplay, which could have highlighted the distinctions more clearly. However, early reports suggest that the Switch 2 version maintains a solid graphical experience by focusing on lighting quality, ensuring that character expressions and overall aesthetics do not suffer.

As we look forward to the game's release on January 22, it raises an exciting question: can the Switch 2 continue to impress with its performance in future titles, or will it struggle against more powerful consoles? The gaming community is eager to find out!
