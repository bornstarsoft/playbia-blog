In a surprising twist, Romero Games has publicly denied rumors of its closure, despite facing significant funding challenges. The studio, founded by industry veterans John and Brenda Romero, recently lost its publishing agreement with Microsoft for an unannounced first-person shooter project, leading to speculation about its future. However, in a statement, Romero Games clarified that it is actively exploring new opportunities with several interested publishers, aiming to bring their game to fruition.

The situation has left many within the studio in shock, with reports of potential layoffs circulating. An anonymous employee described the abruptness of the funding withdrawal as a big shock, emphasizing that the team had meetings with the publisher just before the news broke. Despite the uncertainty, Romero Games remains committed to reassessing its staffing and exploring new partnerships to ensure its survival.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the fate of Romero Games serves as a reminder of the precarious nature of game development funding. Will they secure the support they need to continue their ambitious project? Only time will tell.
