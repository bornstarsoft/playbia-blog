The upcoming LEGO Pokmon collaboration is set to redefine the world of collectibles, with one of the largest and most expensive LEGO sets ever launching next year. Priced at a staggering $649.99, this set will boast an impressive 6,838 pieces, making it the seventh largest LEGO set in history. This move marks a significant shift in the market, as LEGO steps into a space previously dominated by Mattel's Mega brand.

In addition to the flagship set, fans can also look forward to a 587-piece set priced at $59.99 and a 2,050-piece set for $199.99. The release date is slated for March 1, with LEGO Insiders gaining early access on February 27. This collaboration not only caters to adult collectors but also promises to ignite nostalgia among Pokmon fans of all ages.

As we anticipate the launch, one has to wonder: will this partnership set a new standard for collectible toys, and what other franchises might LEGO explore in the future?
