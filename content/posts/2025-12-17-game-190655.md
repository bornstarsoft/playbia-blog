In a surprising twist at The Game Awards, Larian Studios revealed that even major platform holders like PlayStation and Xbox were unaware of their upcoming game in the Divinity series until the big reveal. This secrecy underscores the studio's commitment to keeping their projects under wraps, adding an element of excitement for fans and industry insiders alike. Larian's CEO, Swen Vincke, expressed that the platforms only discovered the games existence during the awards, making it a fun surprise for everyone involved.

This announcement comes on the heels of Larian's success with Baldurs Gate 3, which won six awards at the same event. As the studio shifts focus from the Dungeons & Dragons universe to the Divinity series, the anticipation for this new RPG is palpable. With the tagline, The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir, its clear that Larian aims to deliver an expansive and immersive experience that builds on their previous successes.

As we look forward to more details about this new installment, one has to wonder: how will Larian redefine the RPG landscape once again? The gaming community is eager to find out what Rivellon has in store for us next.
