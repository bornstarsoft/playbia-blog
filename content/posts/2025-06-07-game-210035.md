The gaming world is about to get a fresh twist on corporate culture with the upcoming release of **Pocket Boss**, a puzzle game that cleverly intertwines remote work dynamics and data manipulation. Announced during the Day of the Devs showcase at Summer Game Fest, this innovative title invites players to navigate the often chaotic demands of a virtual boss, all while engaging in a series of mini-games that challenge their strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.

Set primarily within a chat window, players will find themselves responding to their boss's relentless requests to alter data for profit maximization and competitive advantage. The gameplay shifts dramatically with each demand, offering a variety of mini-gamesâ€”from flinging competitors' market shares off the screen to maneuvering through a physical representation of the stock market. This unique approach not only makes for an entertaining experience but also serves as a satirical commentary on the pressures of modern corporate life.

Published by Playables, the studio known for its creative titles like *Time Flies* and *KIDS*, Pocket Boss is poised to capture the attention of gamers and professionals alike. While a release date hasn't been confirmed yet, the excitement surrounding this title suggests it could become a must-play for anyone looking to blend fun with a critique of corporate practices. Will you be ready to tackle the challenges of remote work when Pocket Boss launches on Steam?
