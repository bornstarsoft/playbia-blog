This week's charts reveal not only the resilience of Mario Kart World but also highlight the emergence of new titles like Cronos: The New Dawn, which debuted at number four. The gaming landscape continues to evolve, with digital sales becoming increasingly significant, making it essential for developers and publishers to adapt their strategies accordingly.
