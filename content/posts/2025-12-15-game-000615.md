In a surprising turn of events, Enhance Games has announced that the online services for their popular puzzle game, Humanity, will be discontinued by the end of March 2026. This decision comes after a significant decline in user engagement, particularly with the user-generated stages feature that was the game's primary online component. While players have enjoyed creating and sharing stages, the studio has noted that the service has not been sustainable, leading to this unfortunate conclusion.

Since its launch in 2023, the Humanity community has impressively created over 30,000 stages, showcasing the creativity and enthusiasm of its players. However, as of now, users can no longer upload new stages or share their creations with others, leaving only locally saved stages available for play. This shift marks a significant change for a game that thrived on community interaction and creativity.

As we approach the end of March 2026, many fans are left wondering how this will impact their gaming experience. Will the community find new ways to engage with the game, or will this be the end of an era for Humanity? Share your thoughts below or join the conversation on the forum!
