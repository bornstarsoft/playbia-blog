BitSummit 2025 is set to be an extraordinary celebration of indie games, showcasing 120 unique titles from Japan and around the globe. Scheduled to take place from July 19 to July 21 at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto, this year's theme, "Summer of Yokai," pays homage to the rich tapestry of supernatural creatures found in Japanese folklore. The event promises not only to highlight innovative game development but also to immerse attendees in the cultural narratives that inspire these creative endeavors.

Since its inception in 2012 by the Japan Independent Games Aggregate (JIGA), BitSummit has evolved from a modest gathering of 200 attendees to a massive expo that attracted over 38,000 visitors last year. The growth of this event underscores the increasing global interest in indie games and the vibrant community that surrounds them. With daily coverage from VGC and tickets now available for both local and international attendees, this year's BitSummit is poised to be a landmark event for indie game enthusiasts.

As we look forward to the event, it raises an intriguing question: How will the fusion of traditional folklore with modern gaming narratives shape the future of indie game development? The excitement is palpable, and the stage is set for a remarkable showcase of creativity and innovation.
