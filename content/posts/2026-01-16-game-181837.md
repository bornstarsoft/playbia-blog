In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will be shutting down permanently in just one year. The game has been removed from storefronts, and players will no longer be able to purchase in-game currency starting July 20, 2026. This decision comes as part of Amazon's shift away from MMO development, leaving many fans wondering about the future of their beloved game.

The official shutdown date is set for January 31, 2027, with the game being delisted from sales on January 15, 2026. While players can still access the game they purchased, it will no longer be playable after the shutdown. Amazon expressed gratitude to the community for their dedication and passion, emphasizing the collaborative journey of building the world of Aeternum together.

As we approach the final year of New World, players are left to reflect on their experiences and the memories created in this unique virtual world. What will you miss the most about New World: Aeternum as we prepare for its farewell?
