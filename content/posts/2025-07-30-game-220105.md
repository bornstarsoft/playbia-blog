Nintendo has just rolled out a significant update for Mario Kart World, and one of the most impactful changes is the adjustment of CPU opponents' difficulty. With the Version 1.2.0 patch, players will find that the AI has been made weaker in most modes, making it easier to achieve those coveted three-star ratings in Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. This change is a welcome relief for many players who found the previous difficulty level frustratingly high.

In addition to the AI tweaks, the update introduces several exciting features, including the ability to race with only Mushrooms as items and the option to view replays of downloaded Time Trial ghosts. Players can now also see their waiting time before the next race starts, enhancing the overall gaming experience. Furthermore, the Free Roam mode now provides clearer feedback when all collectibles have been gathered, which should help players feel more accomplished.

As Mario Kart World continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these changes impact player engagement and satisfaction. Will these adjustments lead to a resurgence in popularity for the game? Only time will tell.
