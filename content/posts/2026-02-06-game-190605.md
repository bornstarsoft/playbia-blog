Konami is set to delight fans with the release of a 13-game Goemon collection this summer, bringing classic titles to Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC. This compilation, titled "Ganbare Goemon! Daishuugou," features beloved entries from the Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy eras, showcasing the charm and humor that the series is known for. However, its important to note that the collection is currently only slated for release in Japan, which may leave international fans yearning for more.

The collection promises exciting new features such as rewind, quick save, and turbo buttons, enhancing the gameplay experience for both newcomers and nostalgic players. Additionally, a music player and a gallery of instruction manuals will be included, offering a deeper dive into the Goemon universe. With titles like "The Legend of the Mystical Ninja" and "Ganbare Goemon 3," this compilation is a treasure trove for fans of retro gaming.

As we look forward to its release on July 2, one can't help but wonder: will Konami consider a global release in the future? The excitement surrounding this collection could pave the way for more classic titles to be made available worldwide, and fans are eager to see whats next from this iconic gaming company.
