Nintendo has just announced that the beloved GameCube classic, Luigi's Mansion, will be making its way to the Switch 2's Nintendo Classics library on October 30, just in time for Halloween. This iconic title, originally launched in 2001, has players guiding Luigi through a haunted mansion in search of his missing brother, Mario, armed with his trusty Poltergust 3000 vacuum.

This addition is particularly exciting as it marks the first time all three Luigi's Mansion games will be available on a single console. Players can now enjoy the original GameCube version, the remastered Luigi's Mansion 2 HD from the 3DS, and the latest installment, Luigi's Mansion 3, all in one place. With the Switch 2's expanding library, fans of the franchise have much to look forward to.

As Nintendo continues to roll out GameCube classics, including future titles like Super Mario Sunshine and Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, the nostalgia factor is sure to attract both new players and longtime fans. Are you ready to dive back into the spooky adventures of Luigi this Halloween?
