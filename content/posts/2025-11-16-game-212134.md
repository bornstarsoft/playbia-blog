The Tokyo Monorail is set to launch an exciting real-world puzzle game in collaboration with Little Twin Stars, running from November 14, 2025, to February 28, 2026. This unique event invites participants to explore the scenic monorail route while solving ciphers and decoding messages from the beloved mascot, Monorun. With two beginner-friendly routes to choose from, this game is perfect for both locals and tourists looking for a fun and engaging way to experience Tokyo.

Participants will receive a kit that includes a puzzle booklet, a clip pen, and discounts for local tenants, enhancing the overall experience. With only 3,000 kits available at a participation fee of 2,000 yen, this event promises to be a memorable adventure for all who join. Plus, the first 1,000 participants will receive a special ballpoint pen charm, and those who complete both routes will be rewarded with a bonus smartphone wallpaper. 

As technology continues to blend with entertainment, events like this highlight the innovative ways we can engage with our surroundings. Will you be one of the lucky participants to embark on this whimsical journey?
