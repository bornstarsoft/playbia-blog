Rare has officially announced that paid custom servers will be introduced to Sea of Thieves in early 2026. This exciting development was revealed during the games first community direct, titled Custom Seas. Players will soon have the opportunity to create private servers, which will come with exclusive tools, including a cinematic camera that has previously been used for game trailers. While specific pricing details are yet to be disclosed, Rare has indicated that supporting this feature will require a monthly fee due to its complexity and resource demands.

In addition to the custom servers, Rare is also revamping the games seasonal model. Acknowledging that the game's momentum has stalled, the developer plans to implement a new structure for each season, which will last three months. Each season will consist of three distinct goals: the first month will focus on revitalizing the sandbox experience, the second will highlight live events, and the third will emphasize community engagement.

As Sea of Thieves continues to evolve, the introduction of paid custom servers and a refreshed seasonal model could significantly enhance player engagement and creativity. Are you excited about the possibilities these changes will bring to your adventures on the high seas?
