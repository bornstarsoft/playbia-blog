In a recent Q&A session, Sony's CFO Lin Tao revealed that the highly anticipated game Marathon is expected to launch by the end of March 2026. This announcement comes after a delay was confirmed earlier this year, with Tao emphasizing that the team is actively addressing development issues to ensure a successful release. While she noted that this timeline is not a firm commitment, the optimism surrounding the game's progress is palpable.

Additionally, Tao provided insight into Bungie's evolving role within Sony's structure. Originally acquired with a promise of independence, Bungie is now gradually integrating into PlayStation Studios. This shift aims to enhance collaboration and streamline the development process, ultimately benefiting both the studio and its fanbase. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the future of Bungie under Sony's umbrella raises intriguing questions about creative freedom versus corporate synergy.

With the gaming community eagerly awaiting updates, one can't help but wonder: will Marathon meet the expectations set by its passionate fanbase? Only time will tell as we approach the projected launch window.
