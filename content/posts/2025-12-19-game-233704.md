Gamirror Games is set to launch AiliA, a captivating visual mirror-based puzzle game, on January 9, 2026. This innovative title, developed by IceToad Studio LLC, invites players to step into a world where reality and reflection intertwine. As players assume the role of Aria, they will navigate through a beautifully crafted 3D environment, manipulating mirrors to reshape their surroundings and solve intricate puzzles in a quest to rescue her twin sister.

What sets AiliA apart is its unique gameplay mechanics that challenge players to think creatively and spatially. With over 100 meticulously designed puzzles across seven visually distinct stages inspired by Eastern aesthetics, the game promises an immersive experience that encourages deep exploration. The addition of hidden levels offers even more challenges for those who seek mastery in this enchanting mirrored world.

As the launch date approaches, players can get a taste of the adventure through a playable demo available on Steam. Will you be ready to unravel the mysteries behind the mirrors when AiliA officially launches?
