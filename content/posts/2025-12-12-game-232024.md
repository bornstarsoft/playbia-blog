Jonathan Blow, the visionary behind acclaimed titles like Braid and The Witness, has unveiled his latest project, Order of the Sinking Star, a puzzle game that promises to redefine the genre with over 1,000 puzzles and gameplay that can stretch up to 250 hours. This ambitious endeavor, revealed at The Game Awards 2025, showcases a grid-based isometric adventure that layers complex mechanics as players delve deeper into its expansive world.

The gameplay mechanics are designed to challenge players' understanding of each character's unique abilities, with puzzles that evolve from simple block-pushing mazes to intricate challenges requiring strategic thinking and foresight. As players navigate through the overworld, they will encounter various characters and timelines, each contributing to the overarching narrative while providing a rich puzzle-solving experience.

While the sheer volume of content may seem daunting, Blow's team is considering implementing a hint system to assist players without compromising the game's integrity. As we await its release in 2026, one can't help but wonder how Order of the Sinking Star will influence the future of puzzle games and whether it will captivate both casual gamers and hardcore enthusiasts alike.
