CD Projekt has officially announced that the highly anticipated sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, now simply titled Cyberpunk 2, has entered the preproduction stage. This marks a significant milestone for the franchise, which has garnered a massive following since its initial release. With the new North American arm of CD Projekt Red leading the charge, fans are eager to see how this sequel will expand upon the rich, dystopian universe established in its predecessor.

The transition from conceptual phase to preproduction indicates that the development team is ready to dive deeper into the game's mechanics, storylines, and world-building. Notably, Mike Pondsmith, the creator of the Cyberpunk IP, hinted that the sequel will introduce a new city reminiscent of "Chicago gone wrong," suggesting a fresh and intriguing setting that could redefine the series' narrative landscape. This creative direction promises to engage players with new experiences while staying true to the franchise's core themes.

As Cyberpunk 2 progresses through its development stages, the excitement surrounding the franchise continues to grow, especially with the recent success of the expansion Phantom Liberty, which has sold over 10 million copies. With the upcoming launch of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition on the new Nintendo Switch 2, the timing couldn't be better for CD Projekt to build on its momentum. Will Cyberpunk 2 live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor? Only time will tell, but the anticipation is palpable.
